# ZenRX

**ZenRX** is a high-performance, CPU-only miner for RandomX-based cryptocurrencies.

It is the official mining engine of the **ZenOS platform** (https://zenplatform.dev), designed for tight OS-level integration, automated deployment, and simplified large-scale management.

ZenRX can also be used as a fully standalone miner on Linux and Windows.

Performance is comparable to XMRig for supported algorithms.  
It is **not inherently faster or slower than XMRig** — the focus is architectural simplification and platform integration rather than raw performance changes.

---

# Platform Integration

ZenRX is built specifically for the **ZenOS mining platform**, providing:

- Seamless integration with ZenOS services
- Native monitoring via HTTP API
- Simplified deployment model
- Automated optimization at startup
- MoneroOcean profitability-based auto-switching

Although optimized for ZenOS, ZenRX runs perfectly as a standalone CPU miner.

# Philosophy

ZenRX intentionally removes unnecessary complexity:

- CPU-only
- RandomX-only
- Minimal architecture
- Clean configuration model
- Single stratum implementation
- No GPU abstraction overhead

The result is a focused, maintainable mining core.

# Changes Compared to XMRig

## Removed

- GPU backends (OpenCL, CUDA)
- Non-RandomX algorithms (CryptoNight, KawPow, GhostRider, etc.)
- Proxy and SOCKS5 support
- Hardware monitoring layers (NVML, ADL, DMI)
- Complex multi-backend architecture

## Simplified

- Stratum client (single raw-socket implementation with TLS)
- Flat configuration structure
- Minimal CLI
- HTTP API (single `/api` endpoint)

## Added

- MoneroOcean algorithm profitability benchmarking (`algo-perf`)
- Dual RandomX instances (user + dev) for zero-downtime dev fee switching
- Extended RandomX variants:
  - `rx/xeq`
  - `rx/xla` (Panthera)
- Background RandomX dataset reinitialization on seed hash changes

# Quick Start

## Mine on MoneroOcean (Auto-switching)

```
./zenrx -o gulf.moneroocean.stream:20128 -u YOUR_WALLET -p x
```

## Mine on a specific pool

```
./zenrx -o xmr.kryptex.network:8029 -u YOUR_WALLET/WORKER_NAME
```

## Use a configuration file

```
./zenrx -c zenrx.json
```

---

# Build from Source

## Linux

```
sudo apt install build-essential cmake
./build_zenrx_linux.sh
```

## Windows (cross-compile from Linux)

```
sudo apt install build-essential cmake mingw-w64
./build_zenrx_win.sh
```

---
